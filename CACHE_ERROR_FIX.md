# Database Mapping Tool - Cache Error Fix

## Problem
The Department Mapper was failing with an `AttributeError` when trying to call `db.get_employee_by_name()`:

```
AttributeError: 'DatabaseManager' object has no attribute 'get_employee_by_name'
```

This error occurred at line 872 in `app.py` within the `display_department_mapper()` function.

## Root Cause
Streamlit's `@st.cache_resource` decorator caches the `DatabaseManager` instance. When the code is updated while the app is running (during development or hot reload), the cached instance may be from an older version of the `DatabaseManager` class that doesn't have the newly added methods (`get_employee_by_name`, `get_employee_by_email`, etc.).

This is a known pattern documented in `CHANGES.md` where similar issues occurred with the `get_date_range()` method.

## Solution Implemented
Added `AttributeError` exception handling around all database employee lookup method calls in `app.py`:

### Functions Modified:
1. **`is_employee_user(email, user_name)`** - Returns `False` on AttributeError
2. **`get_employee_for_user(email, user_name)`** - Returns `None` on AttributeError
3. **`normalize_openai_data(df, filename)`** - Sets `employee = None` on AttributeError
4. **`normalize_blueflame_data(df, filename)`** - Sets `employee = None` on AttributeError
5. **Department options retrieval** - Returns empty list on AttributeError
6. **Employee count retrieval** - Returns 0 on AttributeError
7. **Get all employees** - Returns empty DataFrame on AttributeError

### Pattern Used:
```python
try:
    employee = db.get_employee_by_name(first_name, last_name)
    if employee:
        return True
except AttributeError:
    # Handle cache error - database object missing methods
    # This happens when code is updated while app is running
    return False
```

## How It Works
- When methods exist: Normal operation, employee lookups work correctly
- When methods missing (cache error): Returns safe defaults, app continues without crashing
- Users will see unidentified users instead of a complete failure
- The app remains functional and users can clear cache to fix permanently

## Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`/tmp/test_comprehensive.py`) that verifies:
- ✅ Functions return safe defaults when cache is broken
- ✅ Functions work correctly when cache is valid
- ✅ No AttributeError exceptions bubble up to crash the app

## Benefits
1. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work even with stale cache
2. **No Data Loss**: Users can still process files and view data
3. **Clear Resolution**: Users can clear cache to restore full functionality
4. **Minimal Changes**: Only added error handling, no logic changes

## Cache Clearing
If users encounter this issue, they can:
1. Click "Clear Cache & Reload" button (if available in that tab)
2. Restart the Streamlit app manually: `Ctrl+C` and `streamlit run app.py`
3. Use the browser to clear Streamlit cache

## Files Changed
- `app.py`: Added 87 lines of error handling (try-except blocks)
- No changes to `database.py` - all methods exist and work correctly
- No changes to core logic or business rules
