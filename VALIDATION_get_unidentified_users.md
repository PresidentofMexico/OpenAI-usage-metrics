# Validation: get_unidentified_users() Method

## Issue Background (PR #33)
PR #33 introduced a bug where the Department Mapper feature attempted to call `db.get_unidentified_users()` but the method did not exist in the `DatabaseManager` class, causing runtime errors.

## Solution Implemented
The `get_unidentified_users()` method has been added to `database.py` (lines 585-613) and is working correctly.

## Method Specification

### Location
- **File**: `database.py`
- **Class**: `DatabaseManager`
- **Lines**: 585-613

### Signature
```python
def get_unidentified_users(self) -> pd.DataFrame
```

### Purpose
Identifies users in the `usage_metrics` table who are not present in the `employees` table (master employee list), aggregating their usage statistics for review and department mapping.

### Returns
A pandas DataFrame with the following columns:
- `email` - User's email address
- `user_name` - User's full name
- `tools_used` - Comma-separated list of distinct AI tools used
- `total_usage` - Sum of all usage counts
- `total_cost` - Sum of all costs in USD
- `days_active` - Count of distinct dates with activity

### SQL Query Logic
```sql
SELECT 
    um.email,
    um.user_name,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT um.tool_source) as tools_used,
    SUM(um.usage_count) as total_usage,
    SUM(um.cost_usd) as total_cost,
    COUNT(DISTINCT um.date) as days_active
FROM usage_metrics um
LEFT JOIN employees e ON LOWER(um.email) = LOWER(e.email)
WHERE e.email IS NULL AND um.email IS NOT NULL AND um.email != ''
GROUP BY um.email, um.user_name
ORDER BY total_usage DESC
```

### Key Features
1. **Case-insensitive email matching**: Uses `LOWER()` function on both sides of the JOIN
2. **Null safety**: Filters out NULL and empty email addresses
3. **Aggregation**: Calculates total usage, cost, and active days per user
4. **Multi-tool support**: Concatenates distinct tool sources used by each user
5. **Deduplication**: Groups by email and user_name to prevent duplicates
6. **Prioritization**: Sorts by total_usage descending (highest usage first)
7. **Error handling**: Returns empty DataFrame on error

## Integration Points

### 1. Department Mapper Feature (app.py:725)
```python
unidentified_users_df = db.get_unidentified_users()
```

The Department Mapper uses this method to:
- Display users not in the employee master file
- Show their usage statistics (messages, cost, days active)
- Allow manual department assignment
- Highlight high-usage unidentified users for prioritization

### 2. Expected Workflow
1. User uploads AI tool usage data (CSV)
2. User uploads employee master file (CSV)
3. Department Mapper calls `get_unidentified_users()`
4. Unidentified users are displayed with statistics
5. Admin can assign departments to unidentified users
6. Assignments are saved for future analytics

## Test Coverage

### Test File: `test_get_unidentified_users.py`

Comprehensive test suite validates:
- ✅ Identifies unidentified users correctly
- ✅ Excludes identified employees from results
- ✅ Aggregates usage_count, cost_usd correctly
- ✅ Counts distinct active days
- ✅ Concatenates multiple tool sources
- ✅ Groups by email and user_name (no duplicates)
- ✅ Sorts by total_usage descending
- ✅ Handles empty/null emails (excludes them)
- ✅ Returns empty DataFrame when no data exists
- ✅ Handles database errors gracefully

### Test Results
```
============================================================
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
============================================================

The get_unidentified_users() method is working correctly:
  ✓ Returns unidentified users (not in employees table)
  ✓ Aggregates usage_count, cost_usd, and days_active
  ✓ Groups by email and user_name correctly
  ✓ Sorts by total_usage descending
  ✓ Excludes identified employees
  ✓ Handles empty/null emails properly
  ✓ Concatenates multiple tool sources
```

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Used
- `idx_employee_email` - Optimizes LEFT JOIN on employees.email
- `idx_user_date` - May help with date aggregation (if exists)

### Query Optimization
- LEFT JOIN is efficient for finding non-matches
- LOWER() function consistent on both sides for case-insensitive matching
- WHERE clause filters before aggregation
- GROUP BY reduces result set size

### Scalability
- Tested with realistic data volumes
- Aggregation reduces result set (one row per unidentified user)
- Query complexity: O(n log n) due to JOIN and ORDER BY

## Comparison with Proposed Solution

The implemented solution **exactly matches** the proposed solution from the problem statement:

| Aspect | Proposed | Implemented | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Method signature | `def get_unidentified_users(self)` | ✅ Matches | ✅ |
| Returns | DataFrame | ✅ Matches | ✅ |
| SQL query | LEFT JOIN with LOWER() | ✅ Matches | ✅ |
| Columns | email, user_name, tools_used, etc. | ✅ Matches | ✅ |
| Aggregations | SUM, COUNT, GROUP_CONCAT | ✅ Matches | ✅ |
| Sorting | ORDER BY total_usage DESC | ✅ Matches | ✅ |
| Error handling | Returns empty DataFrame | ✅ Matches | ✅ |

## Conclusion

✅ **The fix for PR #33 is complete and verified:**

1. Method exists in `database.py` (lines 585-613)
2. Implementation matches proposed solution exactly
3. Comprehensive test coverage with all tests passing
4. Proper integration with Department Mapper feature
5. SQL query is optimized and efficient
6. Error handling is robust
7. Documentation is complete

The bug introduced in PR #33 has been successfully resolved.
