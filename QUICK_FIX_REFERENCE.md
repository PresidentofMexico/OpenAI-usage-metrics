# Quick Reference: Department Performance Fix

## The Problem
Department Performance showed 'Unknown' as #1 department with 300k+ messages, but Unidentified Users only showed 48 users with 30-40k messages total. **Discrepancy: ~250k+ messages from verified employees incorrectly counted as 'Unknown'.**

## The Solution
Added `apply_employee_departments()` function that ensures the employee master file drives ALL department assignments across the entire dashboard, not just Power Users.

## How to Verify the Fix Works

### Quick Test
```bash
python test_department_employee_fix.py
```
Expected: ✅ All tests pass

### Visual Demo
```bash
python demo_department_fix.py
```
Expected: Shows bug (Unknown with 318k) and fix (Corporate Credit with 230k)

### In the Dashboard

1. **Upload employee master file** (Database Management tab)
2. **Upload usage data** (CSV with departments)
3. **Check Executive Summary** → Department Performance:
   - Employees show departments from master file ✅
   - 'Unknown' only includes non-employees ✅
4. **Check Database Management** → Unidentified Users:
   - Should match 'Unknown' department count ✅
   - No employees listed ✅

## What Changed

### Before Fix ❌
```python
# Old data flow
data = db.get_all_data()
data = apply_department_mappings(data, dept_mappings)  # Manual mappings only
dept_stats = data.groupby('department').agg({...})     # Wrong departments!
```

### After Fix ✅
```python
# New data flow  
data = db.get_all_data()
data = apply_employee_departments(data)                # Employee master file FIRST
data = apply_department_mappings(data, dept_mappings)  # Manual mappings SECOND
dept_stats = data.groupby('department').agg({...})     # Correct departments!
```
