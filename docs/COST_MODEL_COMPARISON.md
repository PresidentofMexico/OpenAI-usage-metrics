# Cost Model Comparison: Before vs. After

## Before: Per-Message Pricing (Incorrect)

```
üìä September 2024 Example: 159 Users, 114,247 Messages

Old Calculation:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatGPT Messages: 114,247 √ó $0.02 = $2,284.94
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tool Messages: (additional) √ó $0.01
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Messages: (additional) √ó $0.015
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TOTAL: ~$2,500-$3,000/month ‚ùå UNDERESTIMATED

Problems:
‚ùå Not how enterprise licenses work
‚ùå Vastly underestimates true cost
‚ùå Misleading for budget planning
‚ùå Can't justify ROI properly
```

## After: Enterprise License Pricing (Accurate)

```
üíº September 2024 Example: 159 Users, 114,247 Messages

New Calculation:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatGPT Enterprise Licenses: 159 users √ó $60/user = $9,540/month
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tool Messages: INCLUDED in license (cost = $0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project Messages: INCLUDED in license (cost = $0)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GPT Messages: INCLUDED in license (cost = $0)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TOTAL: $9,540/month ‚úÖ ACCURATE

Annual Projection:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Monthly: $9,540
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Annual: $9,540 √ó 12 = $114,480
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Per User: $720/year

Engagement Metrics:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Messages per User: 719/month
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cost per Message: $0.0835
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ License Utilization: ‚úÖ High (>50 msgs/user)

Benefits:
‚úÖ Reflects actual enterprise license costs
‚úÖ Enables accurate budget planning
‚úÖ Supports ROI justification
‚úÖ Identifies optimization opportunities
