# Power Users Department Display Fix

## Problem Statement

Users Jack Steed and Tyler Mackesy were verified in the employee master file with locked departments of "Corporate Credit", but the Power Users section showed their department as "Unknown". This caused "Unknown" to appear as the largest used category in the Executive Summary metrics, skewing the analytics.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Location
The bug was in the `calculate_power_users()` function in `app.py` (line 1266).

### Why It Happened

1. **Data Normalization Works Correctly**: When usage data is uploaded and normalized (in `normalize_openai_data()` and `normalize_blueflame_data()`), the code correctly looks up employees in the database and assigns their departments.

2. **The Problem in Aggregation**: However, when calculating power users, the function aggregated usage by email and used this logic:
   ```python
   'department': lambda x: _select_primary_department(x)
   ```
   
3. **What Went Wrong**: The `_select_primary_department()` function only looked at department values already present in the `usage_metrics` table. It did NOT consult the employee database.

4. **The Result**: If a user had usage records with mixed departments (e.g., some marked 'Unknown' and some marked correctly), the function could select 'Unknown' as the department, even though the user was a verified employee with a locked department.

### Example Scenario

For Jack Steed:
- Employee database shows: `department = "Corporate Credit"`
- Usage metrics table has records with:
  - 2 records with `department = "Unknown"` 
  - 1 record with `department = "Corporate Credit"`
- Old code would aggregate these and potentially select "Unknown"
- Power Users display showed "Unknown" instead of "Corporate Credit"

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced `calculate_power_users()` Function
**File**: `app.py` (lines 1280-1285)

Added a loop after the aggregation to update departments from the employee database:

```python
# Update departments from employee database as authoritative source
# This ensures verified employees show their correct locked departments
for idx, row in user_usage.iterrows():
    employee = get_employee_for_user(row['email'], row['user_name'])
    if employee and employee.get('department'):
        user_usage.at[idx, 'department'] = employee['department']
```

**How it works**:
- After grouping users by email and aggregating their usage
- Loop through each user in the result
- Check if the user exists in the employee database (by email or name)
- If found, replace the aggregated department with the authoritative department from the employee record
- Non-employees keep their aggregated department (typically "Unknown")

#### 2. Improved `_select_primary_department()` Function
**File**: `app.py` (lines 1297-1316)

Enhanced the department selection logic to filter out placeholder values:

```python
def _select_primary_department(departments):
    """Select the most appropriate department from a list.
    
    Prefers valid department names over placeholder values like 'BlueFlame Users' 
    or 'Unknown'. If multiple valid departments exist, returns the first one.
    Returns placeholder values only if that's all that's available.
    """
    unique_depts = list(departments.unique())
    
    # Filter out placeholder departments if real departments exist
    real_depts = [d for d in unique_depts if d not in ('BlueFlame Users', 'Unknown')]
    
    if real_depts:
        return real_depts[0]  # Return first real department
    
    # If only placeholders available, prefer 'BlueFlame Users' over 'Unknown'
    if 'BlueFlame Users' in unique_depts:
        return 'BlueFlame Users'
    
    return unique_depts[0] if unique_depts else 'Unknown'
```

**Improvements**:
- Now filters out both 'BlueFlame Users' AND 'Unknown' when real departments exist
- Prioritizes actual department names over placeholder values
- Acts as a secondary safeguard even without the employee database lookup

### How the Fix Works Together

The solution has two layers of protection:

1. **Primary Fix** (`calculate_power_users` loop): Authoritative lookup in employee database
   - This is the main fix that directly addresses the root cause
   - Uses the existing `get_employee_for_user()` helper function
   - Same approach used in data normalization
   
2. **Secondary Fix** (`_select_primary_department` improvement): Better fallback logic
   - Helps in edge cases where employee lookup might fail
   - Prevents 'Unknown' from being selected when valid departments exist
   - Defensive programming

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test: `test_power_user_department_fix.py`

### Test Scenarios

1. **Jack Steed**: Mix of 'Unknown' and 'Corporate Credit' records
   - ✅ Correctly shows 'Corporate Credit' from employee database
   
2. **Tyler Mackesy**: All records marked 'Unknown'
   - ✅ Correctly shows 'Corporate Credit' from employee database
   
3. **Alice Johnson**: All records correctly marked 'Engineering'
   - ✅ Still shows 'Engineering' (no regression)
   
4. **Unknown User**: User NOT in employee database
   - ✅ Still shows 'Unknown' (correct behavior for non-employees)

### Test Results
```
======================================================================
ALL TESTS PASSED! ✓
======================================================================

Summary:
- Verified employees now show their locked departments
- Jack Steed: Corporate Credit (was showing Unknown)
- Tyler Mackesy: Corporate Credit (was showing Unknown)
- Non-employees still correctly show Unknown
- Fix prevents 'Unknown' from being the largest category
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Jack Steed shown as department "Unknown"
- ❌ Tyler Mackesy shown as department "Unknown"
- ❌ Executive Summary skewed - "Unknown" as largest category
- ❌ Incorrect analytics and reporting

### After Fix
- ✅ Jack Steed correctly shows "Corporate Credit"
- ✅ Tyler Mackesy correctly shows "Corporate Credit"
- ✅ Executive Summary accurately reflects actual department usage
- ✅ Verified employees always show their locked department
- ✅ Non-employees still correctly identified as "Unknown"

## Technical Notes

### Employee Lookup Process

The fix leverages the existing `get_employee_for_user()` helper function which:

1. First tries to match by email: `db.get_employee_by_email(email)`
2. If no match, tries to match by name: `db.get_employee_by_name(first_name, last_name)`
3. Returns the employee record with authoritative department information
4. Returns `None` if user is not in the employee database

### Why This Approach

**Consistency**: Uses the same employee lookup logic as the data normalization process, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

**Authoritative Source**: The employee database is treated as the single source of truth for department information for verified employees.

**Minimal Changes**: The fix is surgical - only modifies the power user calculation logic without affecting data normalization or storage.

**Backward Compatible**: Non-employees and edge cases still work correctly.

- `test_power_user_department_fix.py` - Comprehensive test coverage
- `test_critical_fixes.py` - Existing tests still pass

## Deployment Notes

- No database migration required
- No impact to existing employee records or usage data
- Fix is applied at query/display time, not at storage time
- Existing data in database remains unchanged
- Fix is effective immediately upon deployment

## Future Considerations

### Potential Optimization

Currently the fix loops through power users and looks up each one individually in the employee database. If performance becomes an issue with many power users, consider:

1. Pre-load all employee records into a dictionary keyed by email
2. Perform dictionary lookups instead of database queries
3. This would reduce database calls from O(n) to O(1) per user

Example optimization (if needed):
```python
# Pre-load employees
employee_dict = {emp['email']: emp for emp in db.get_all_employees()}

# Then use dictionary lookup
for idx, row in user_usage.iterrows():
    employee = employee_dict.get(row['email'])
    if employee and employee.get('department'):
        user_usage.at[idx, 'department'] = employee['department']
```

However, since power users are typically a small subset (top 5%), the current approach is fine for most use cases.

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix in production:

1. Navigate to the Power Users tab in the dashboard
2. Locate Jack Steed and Tyler Mackesy in the power user list
3. Verify their department shows "Corporate Credit" 
4. Check the Executive Summary metrics
5. Confirm "Unknown" is no longer the largest category (unless legitimately so)
