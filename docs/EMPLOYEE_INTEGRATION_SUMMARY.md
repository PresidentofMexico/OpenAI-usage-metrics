- New `employees` table created with proper structure
- Email as unique identifier with case-insensitive lookup
- Indexed for fast queries
- Automatic update/insert on employee upload

### 2. **Employee Management** ✅
- CSV/Excel file upload support in Database Management tab
- Flexible column mapping interface
- Automatic deduplication by email
- View employees functionality

### 3. **Automatic Department Assignment** ✅
- Employee lookup during data normalization
- Department override from employee table
- Unidentified users flagged automatically
- Works for both OpenAI and BlueFlame data

### 4. **Enhanced Department Mapper** ✅
- Dynamic department list from employee table
- Read-only departments for employees (🔒 icon)
- Editable mapping for unidentified users only
- Filter by: All Users / Employees Only / Unidentified Only
- Visual indicators: ✅ Employee / ⚠️ Unidentified

### 5. **Unidentified Users Tracking** ✅
- Dedicated section showing non-employees
- Usage statistics (messages, cost, days active)
- Tools used tracking
- Easy identification for security/compliance

## 📊 Test Results

### Comprehensive Integration Test
```
============================================================
EMPLOYEE MASTER FILE INTEGRATION TEST
============================================================

✅ Database initialized
✅ Employee master file loaded (10 employees)
✅ Employee departments verified (10 departments)
✅ Test usage data created and normalized
✅ All department assignments verified
   ✅ john.doe@company.com: Engineering (from employee roster)
   ✅ jane.smith@company.com: Product (from employee roster)
   ⚠️  contractor@external.com: Unidentified User (not in employee roster)
   ✅ alice.williams@company.com: Marketing (from employee roster)
✅ Usage data inserted
✅ Unidentified users correctly identified (1 user)
✅ Employee count verified (10)
✅ All users verified (4)

✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Methods Added
```python
# Employee management
db.load_employees(df) → (success, message, count)
db.get_employee_by_email(email) → employee_dict
db.get_all_employees() → DataFrame
db.get_employee_departments() → List[str]
db.get_unidentified_users() → DataFrame
db.get_employee_count() → int
```

### Data Normalization Flow
1. User email extracted from usage data
2. Lookup in `employees` table
3. **If found**: Use employee's department and name
4. **If not found**: Flag as "Unidentified User"
5. Insert into usage_metrics table

### Department Mapper Logic
1. Load departments from `employees` table dynamically
2. Add standard options for unidentified users
3. Check if user is employee (read-only dept)
4. Allow editing only for non-employees
5. Visual indicators show user type

## 📋 Employee File Format

### Required Columns
- **First Name** - Employee's first name
- **Last Name** - Employee's last name  
- **Email** - Unique identifier (case-insensitive)
- **Title** - Job title/position
- **Function** - Department (maps to 'department' field)
- **Status** - Employment status

### Sample Data
```csv
First Name,Last Name,Email,Title,Function,Status
John,Doe,john.doe@company.com,Senior Engineer,Engineering,Active
Jane,Smith,jane.smith@company.com,Product Manager,Product,Active
```

## 🎨 UI Components Added

### Database Management Tab
- **Employee Master File section**
  - Upload employee CSV/Excel
  - Column mapping interface
  - Employee count display
  - View employees button

### Department Mapper Tab
- **Unidentified Users section** (expandable)
  - List of non-employee users
  - Usage statistics per user
  - Tools used
  
- **All Users table** (enhanced)
  - Type column (✅ Employee / ⚠️ Unidentified)
  - Read-only departments for employees
  - Filter options
  - Visual indicators

## 🔍 Code Quality

- ✅ All functions tested and working
- ✅ Type safety with proper error handling
- ✅ Database transactions with commit/rollback
- ✅ Case-insensitive email matching
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing data

## 🚀 Usage Example

```python
# 1. Load employees
emp_df = pd.read_csv('employees.csv')
success, msg, count = db.load_employees(emp_df)
# → Loaded 10 employees (10 new, 0 updated)

# 2. Upload usage data (automatic lookup happens)
usage_df = pd.read_csv('openai_usage.csv')
normalized_df = normalize_openai_data(usage_df, 'openai_usage.csv')
# → Employees get correct departments
# → Non-employees flagged as "Unidentified User"

# 3. Check unidentified users
unidentified = db.get_unidentified_users()
print(f"Found {len(unidentified)} unidentified users")
# → contractor@external.com: External Contractor (80 messages)
```
