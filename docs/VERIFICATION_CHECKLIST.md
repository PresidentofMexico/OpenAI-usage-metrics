## Post-Deployment Verification

### Manual Testing (To be completed by user)
- [ ] Navigate to Power Users tab in the dashboard
- [ ] Verify Jack Steed shows department "Corporate Credit" (not "Unknown")
- [ ] Verify Tyler Mackesy shows department "Corporate Credit" (not "Unknown")
- [ ] Check Executive Summary - "Unknown" should not be largest category
- [ ] Verify Department Mapper shows them as verified employees
- [ ] Test with other users to ensure no regressions

### Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] Power Users count (should remain similar)
- [ ] Department distribution in Executive Summary (should be more accurate)
- [ ] "Unknown" category percentage (should decrease significantly)
