   📊 Total Messages: 318,000
   👥 Active Users: 5
   💰 Total Cost: $300.00
   📈 Avg Messages/User: 63,600

### Database Management - Unidentified Users Section
```
⚠️ Unidentified Users

```

### ❌ The Discrepancy
- **Department Performance**: 'Unknown' shows 318,000 messages
- **Unidentified Users**: Only 18,000 messages from 2 users
- **Missing**: 300,000 messages unaccounted for!
- **Problem**: Employees Jack Steed, Tyler Mackesy, and Bob Smith are counted under 'Unknown' instead of their actual departments

## Technical Details

### Data Source Hierarchy (After Fix)

1. **Employee Master File** (Highest Priority)
   - Authoritative source for all employees
   - Applied to ALL data, not just Power Users
   
2. **Manual Department Mappings** (Medium Priority)
   - For non-employees or overrides
   - Applied after employee departments
   
3. **CSV Upload Data** (Lowest Priority)
   - Used only if no employee or manual mapping exists
   - Often incorrect or outdated

### Code Change Location

**File:** `app.py`  
**Lines:** 1880-1901

```python
# OLD (WRONG)
data = db.get_all_data()
data = apply_department_mappings(data, dept_mappings)

# NEW (CORRECT)  
data = db.get_all_data()
data = apply_employee_departments(data)           # FIRST
data = apply_department_mappings(data, dept_mappings)  # SECOND
```

This ensures employee master file is ALWAYS the source of truth.
