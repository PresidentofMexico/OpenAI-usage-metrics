# Pull Request Summary: Department Performance Bug Fix

## Overview
Fixed critical discrepancy where Department Performance showed 'Unknown' as #1 department with 300k+ messages, while Unidentified Users section only showed 48 users with 30-40k messages total.

**Root Cause:** Employee master file was only applied to Power Users section, not to the main dataset used for Department Performance analytics.

**Solution:** Created `apply_employee_departments()` function that ensures employee master file is the authoritative source for ALL department assignments across the entire dashboard.

## Key Changes

### Data Loading Flow

**Before:**
```python
data = db.get_all_data()
data = apply_department_mappings(data, dept_mappings)
# Employee departments NOT applied to main data
```

**After:**
```python
data = db.get_all_data()
data = apply_employee_departments(data)                # FIRST (authoritative)
data = apply_department_mappings(data, dept_mappings)  # SECOND (overrides)
# Employee master file is single source of truth
```

### New Function: apply_employee_departments()

```python
def apply_employee_departments(data, db_manager=None):
    """
    Apply employee master file departments to all data.
    
    This ensures the employee master file is the authoritative source for 
    department assignments for all employees, not just power users.
    """
    # Efficient lookup using dictionaries
    # Email-based matching (primary)
    # Name-based matching (fallback)
    # Only updates employees; non-employees keep existing departments
```

**Features:**
- Efficient O(1) dictionary lookups instead of O(n) database queries
- Supports both email and name-based matching
- Handles null/missing values gracefully
- Only updates employee records

## Impact

‚úÖ **Employee master file is now single source of truth**
- Consistent across ALL dashboard sections
- No more discrepancies

‚úÖ **Department Performance shows accurate distribution**
- Correct top departments
- 'Unknown' only includes non-employees

‚úÖ **Perfect data consistency**
- Department Performance ‚Üî Unidentified Users
- Executive Summary ‚Üî Power Users
- All sections aligned

‚úÖ **Accurate cost allocation**
- Proper budgeting by department
- Correct ROI analysis

‚úÖ **No regressions**
- All existing tests pass
- Backward compatible
- Power Users fix still works

## Verification Steps

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run new test suite
python test_department_employee_fix.py

# Run visual demo
python demo_department_fix.py

# Run all existing tests
python test_critical_fixes.py
python test_power_user_department_fix.py
python test_integration_dept_mapper.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Upload employee master file (Database Management)
2. Upload usage data with departments
3. Check Executive Summary ‚Üí Department Performance
   - Employees show master file departments ‚úÖ
   - 'Unknown' only non-employees ‚úÖ
4. Check Database Management ‚Üí Unidentified Users
   - Matches 'Unknown' count ‚úÖ
