# Pagination Button Fix - Tab Switching Issue Resolved

## Problem
The Previous/Next pagination buttons in the Department Mapper were causing the app to switch back to the first tab (Executive Overview) when clicked, even though the pagination state was being updated correctly. The page dropdown selector worked fine.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by explicit `st.rerun()` calls after modifying session state in button click handlers. When `st.rerun()` is explicitly called, Streamlit triggers a full app rerun that resets UI state, including the active tab, causing users to lose their place.

The dropdown worked because Streamlit handles selectbox value changes through its natural rerun mechanism, which preserves widget states including the active tab.

## Solution
Removed all explicit `st.rerun()` calls from the pagination controls in the Department Mapper:

1. **Previous button** (line 756): Removed `st.rerun()` after page decrement
2. **Next button** (line 774): Removed `st.rerun()` after page increment  
3. **Page selector dropdown** (line 769): Removed `st.rerun()` after page selection
4. **Save button** (line 849): Removed `st.rerun()` after saving mappings

## How It Works
In Streamlit 1.28.0+, when session state is modified, Streamlit automatically queues a rerun of the app. This natural rerun mechanism preserves widget states, including which tab is active. By removing explicit `st.rerun()` calls and relying on Streamlit's automatic rerun behavior, the pagination buttons now work correctly while maintaining the active tab.

### Code Change Example

**Before (buggy):**
```python
if st.button("Next ▶️", key=f"next_{position}", 
             disabled=(st.session_state.dept_mapper_page >= total_pages - 1)):
    st.session_state.dept_mapper_page += 1
    st.rerun()  # ← This causes tab reset!
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
if st.button("Next ▶️", key=f"next_{position}", 
             disabled=(st.session_state.dept_mapper_page >= total_pages - 1)):
    st.session_state.dept_mapper_page += 1
    # No st.rerun() - Streamlit auto-reruns and preserves tab state!
```

## Testing
All existing pagination tests pass:
- ✅ Pagination logic works correctly
- ✅ Edge cases handled (0, 1, 20, 21, 100+ users)
- ✅ Previous/Next buttons function properly
- ✅ Page selector dropdown works
- ✅ Search integration preserved
- ✅ Button disabled states correct

Additional integration tests created to validate:
- ✅ State updates without explicit st.rerun()
- ✅ Tab preservation behavior
- ✅ Full pagination workflow

## Files Changed
- `app.py`: Removed 4 `st.rerun()` calls from pagination controls (lines 756, 769, 774, 849)

## Impact
- ✅ **Previous/Next buttons now work correctly** - navigate pages without tab switching
- ✅ **Tabs remain active** - users stay on Department Mapper tab during pagination
- ✅ **Better UX** - smooth navigation without losing context
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - all navigation methods (buttons, dropdown) work the same way

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No database or API changes
- ✅ Existing tests still pass
