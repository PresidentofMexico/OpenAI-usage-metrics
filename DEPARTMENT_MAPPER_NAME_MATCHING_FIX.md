# Department Mapping Tool Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

Users were experiencing two issues with the Department Mapping Tool:

1. **Employees appearing as "Unidentified User"**: Devon McHugh and other employees listed in the employee_records file (row 49, etc.) were showing as "Unidentified User" instead of being recognized as employees.

2. **Department dropdown options not aligned**: The dropdown options did not show all 58 available functions from the employee file (starting alphabetically with 'Administrative - Capital Formation').

## Root Cause

The employee file structure had columns: **Last Name, First Name, Title, Function, Status** - but **NO email column**.

The system was designed to match users exclusively by email address using `db.get_employee_by_email(user_email)`. Since:
- The employee file had no email column
- The database required email as a `UNIQUE NOT NULL` field
- Employee loading would fail without email addresses

Result: **No employees could be loaded, so everyone appeared as "Unidentified User"** and department options were empty.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Made Email Column Optional in Database Schema
**File**: `database.py` (line 45)

Changed from:
```python
email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
```

To:
```python
email TEXT UNIQUE
```

This allows employees to be stored without email addresses.

### 2. Added Name-Based Matching as Fallback
**File**: `database.py` (lines 594-625)

Added new method `get_employee_by_name(first_name, last_name)` that matches employees by their first and last name when email is not available:

```python
def get_employee_by_name(self, first_name, last_name):
    """Get employee record by first and last name."""
    cursor = conn.execute(
        "SELECT ... FROM employees WHERE LOWER(first_name) = ? AND LOWER(last_name) = ?",
        (first_name.strip().lower(), last_name.strip().lower())
    )
```

### 3. Updated Employee Loading Logic
**File**: `database.py` (lines 451-542)

Enhanced `load_employees()` to:
- Accept files with or without email column
- Handle NaN/float values in data
- Match existing employees by email first, then by name
- Use name-based uniqueness when email is not available

### 4. Updated Data Normalization Functions
**File**: `app.py` (lines 428-541, 560-592)

Modified `normalize_openai_data()` and `normalize_blueflame_data()` to:
- Try email-based lookup first
- Fall back to name-based lookup if email match fails
- Parse user names and match against employee records

```python
# Try email lookup first
employee = db.get_employee_by_email(user_email) if user_email else None

# If no match by email, try matching by name
if not employee and user_name:
    name_parts = user_name.strip().split()
    if len(name_parts) >= 2:
        first_name = name_parts[0]
        last_name = ' '.join(name_parts[1:])
        employee = db.get_employee_by_name(first_name, last_name)
```

### 5. Added Helper Functions for Employee Lookup
**File**: `app.py` (lines 75-140)

Created convenience functions:
- `is_employee_user(email, user_name)` - Check if user is an employee
- `get_employee_for_user(email, user_name)` - Get employee record with fallback

### 6. Updated Department Mapper UI Logic
**File**: `app.py` (lines 858, 967-970)

- Updated employee status check to use name-based matching
- Updated department display to use new helper functions

### 7. Made Email Column Optional in Upload UI
**File**: `app.py` (lines 2163-2177)

Added `[No Email Column]` option in the column mapping interface with informational message:

```python
email_col_options = ['[No Email Column]'] + list(emp_df.columns)
st.info("ℹ️ Email column is optional. If your file doesn't have email addresses, 
         employees will be matched by name.")
```

### 8. Updated Unidentified Users Query
**File**: `database.py` (lines 652-683)

Modified SQL query to check both email and name-based matching when identifying unidentified users.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Created comprehensive tests covering:
- Employee loading without email column
- Name-based lookup functionality  
- Employee updates by name
- Mixed scenarios (some with email, some without)

### Integration Tests
Verified:
- ✅ Devon McHugh correctly identified as Employee (not Unidentified)
- ✅ Department assigned: "Compliance"
- ✅ All 58 departments loaded into dropdown
- ✅ 'Administrative - Capital Formation' in department options
- ✅ 282 employees loaded from actual employee file
- ✅ Name-based matching works for users with emails not in employee file

## Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Employee file required email column - couldn't load without it
- ❌ Devon McHugh shown as "⚠️ Unidentified User"  
- ❌ Department dropdown empty or wrong options
- ❌ All users appeared unidentified even if in employee file

### After Fix
- ✅ Employee file can be loaded WITHOUT email column
- ✅ Name-based matching works as fallback to email matching
- ✅ Devon McHugh correctly identified as "✅ Employee" in Compliance
- ✅ Department dropdown has all 58 departments from employee file
- ✅ Includes 'Administrative - Capital Formation' and all other functions
- ✅ Users matched by name even when emails don't match exactly

## Files Modified

1. `database.py` - Database schema and employee management methods
2. `app.py` - Data normalization, UI components, helper functions

## Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains full backward compatibility:
- Employee files WITH email column continue to work normally
- Email-based matching is tried first (primary method)
- Name-based matching only activates as fallback
- Existing databases and data are unaffected
- All existing tests pass
