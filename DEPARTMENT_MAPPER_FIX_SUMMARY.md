# Department Mapper Deduplication Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement

Users who have records from both OpenAI ChatGPT and BlueFlame AI were appearing as **duplicate entries** in the Department Mapper UI.

### Example
**Kaan Erturk** appeared twice in the Department Mapper:
- Once with department: `finance` (from OpenAI data)
- Once with department: `BlueFlame Users` (from BlueFlame data)

This made it difficult to manage department assignments and resulted in a confusing user experience.

## Root Cause

The `display_department_mapper()` function was using `drop_duplicates()` on the combination of `['email', 'user_name', 'department']`. When a user had different department values from different AI tools, they appeared as separate entries despite having the same email address.

### Old Code (Buggy)
```python
# Get unique users
users_df = all_data[['email', 'user_name', 'department']].drop_duplicates()
users_df = users_df.sort_values('user_name')
```

This approach treated the same user with different departments as separate users, creating duplicates.

## Solution

The fix applies the same deduplication strategy already successfully used in the `calculate_power_users()` function:

1. **Deduplicate by email only** - Group users by email address
2. **Use smart department selection** - Leverage the existing `_select_primary_department()` function to choose the most appropriate department
3. **Track tool sources** - Aggregate all AI tools used by each user
4. **Visual indicators** - Add a 🔗 icon for users who utilize multiple AI tools

### New Code (Fixed)
```python
# Deduplicate users by email only, using smart department selection
# This prevents users who appear in both OpenAI and BlueFlame from showing as duplicates
users_df = all_data.groupby('email').agg({
    'user_name': 'first',
    'department': lambda x: _select_primary_department(x),
    'tool_source': lambda x: ', '.join(sorted(x.unique()))
}).reset_index()
users_df = users_df.sort_values('user_name')
```

### Visual Indicator Enhancement
```python
# Show user name with multi-tool indicator
user_display = row['user_name']
if ', ' in row['tool_source']:  # User has multiple AI tools
    user_display = f"🔗 {user_display}"
st.write(user_display)

# Show email with tool sources on hover (using st.text for help parameter support)
st.text(row['email'], help=f"Tools: {row['tool_source']}")
```

## Smart Department Selection Logic

The `_select_primary_department()` function prioritizes organizational departments over generic ones:

1. **Prefer non-BlueFlame departments** - If a user has both `finance` and `BlueFlame Users`, select `finance`
2. **Return first non-generic department** - When multiple real departments exist, use the first one
3. **Fallback to generic** - Only return `BlueFlame Users` if that's the only department available

This ensures users get assigned to their actual organizational department rather than the generic tool-specific department.

## Results

  Jane Smith           | jane.smith@company.com              | Analytics           ← DUPLICATE
  John Doe             | john.doe@company.com                | IT                  
  Kaan Erturk          | kaan.erturk@company.com             | BlueFlame Users     
  Kaan Erturk          | kaan.erturk@company.com             | finance             ← DUPLICATE

  Sarah Wilson         | sarah.wilson@company.com            | Product             ← DUPLICATE
```

### After (Fixed Behavior)
```
Total users shown: 5

   Bob Jones            | bob.jones@company.com               | BlueFlame Users     
🔗 Jane Smith           | jane.smith@company.com              | Analytics           
   John Doe             | john.doe@company.com                | IT                  
🔗 Kaan Erturk          | kaan.erturk@company.com             | finance

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **3 duplicates removed** (8 → 5 unique users)
- ✅ **Multi-tool users clearly identified** with 🔗 icon
- ✅ **Smart department selection** (prefers organizational departments)
- ✅ **Tool visibility** (hover over email to see which AI tools the user utilizes)

## Related Fixes

This fix follows the same pattern as the **Power User Directory Deduplication Fix** (see `POWER_USER_FIX_SUMMARY.md`):

- Same root cause (grouping by email+department instead of email only)
- Same solution (group by email, use `_select_primary_department()`)
- Consistent user experience across all features
- Leverages existing helper functions

## Conclusion

The Department Mapper now correctly deduplicates users who appear in multiple AI tool datasets, providing a cleaner and more accurate interface for managing department assignments. The fix is minimal, well-tested, and maintains full backward compatibility.

**Users benefit from:**
- Fewer duplicate entries to manage
- Clear visibility into which users use multiple AI tools
- Smart department selection that prefers organizational departments
- Consistent behavior across all analytics features
