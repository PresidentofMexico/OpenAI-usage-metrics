# Department Mapping Tool - Name-Based Employee Matching Fix

## Issue Summary

Users reported two critical issues with the Department Mapping Tool:

1. **Devon McHugh and other employees showing as "Unidentified User"** despite being listed in row 49 (and others) of the uploaded employee_records file
2. **Department dropdown options not aligning** with the 58 available functions in the employee file (should start with 'Administrative - Capital Formation')

## Root Cause

The employee file structure contained:
- Column A: `Last Name`
- Column B: `First Name`  
- Column C: `Title`
- Column D: `Function/Department`
- Column E: `Status`

**Critical Issue**: No email column was present in the employee file.

The system was designed to match users exclusively by email using `db.get_employee_by_email(user_email)`. Since the database required email as `UNIQUE NOT NULL` and the file had no email column, employee loading would fail, resulting in:
- No employees being loaded into the database
- All users appearing as "Unidentified User"
- Empty department dropdown options

## Solution

Implemented a **name-based matching system as a fallback** to email matching:

### Key Changes

1. **Database Schema Update** (`database.py`)
   - Made email column optional: `email TEXT UNIQUE` (removed `NOT NULL`)
   - Added `get_employee_by_name(first_name, last_name)` method
   - Enhanced `load_employees()` to handle files without email
   - Fixed data type handling for NaN/float values

2. **Data Normalization Updates** (`app.py`)
   - Updated `normalize_openai_data()` to try name-based matching as fallback
   - Updated `normalize_blueflame_data()` to try name-based matching as fallback
   - Added helper functions: `is_employee_user()` and `get_employee_for_user()`
   - Updated department mapper to use dual matching (email → name)

3. **UI Enhancements** (`app.py`)
   - Added `[No Email Column]` option in column mapping interface
   - Added informational message about optional email column
   - Updated employee status checks to use name-based matching

4. **Query Optimization** (`database.py`)
   - Updated `get_unidentified_users()` to check both email and name matching
   - Improved SQL queries to handle dual matching scenarios

## Testing & Verification

### Automated Tests
- ✅ Unit tests for name-based employee lookup
- ✅ Integration tests with actual employee file (282 employees loaded)
- ✅ Devon McHugh successfully identified by name
- ✅ All 58 departments loaded into dropdown
- ✅ Backward compatibility verified (files with email still work)

### Manual Verification Results
```
✅ Loaded 282 employees (282 new, 1 updated)

✅ DEVON McHUGH FOUND:
   Name: Devon McHugh
   Title: Associate
   Department: Compliance
   Status: ECMS

✅ Department Dropdown Options: 58 unique departments
   1. Administrative - Capital Formation
   2. Administrative - Communications
   3. Administrative - Corporate Credit
   ... (and 55 more)
```

## Files Modified

- `database.py` - Database schema, employee management, SQL queries (117 lines changed)
- `app.py` - Normalization functions, UI components, helper functions (101 lines changed)
- `DEPARTMENT_MAPPER_NAME_MATCHING_FIX.md` - Technical documentation
- `UI_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md` - User guide for verification

**Total Changes**: 472 insertions, 32 deletions across 4 files

## Impact & Benefits

### Before Fix
- ❌ Required email column in employee files
- ❌ All employees appeared as "Unidentified User"
- ❌ Department dropdown empty or incorrect
- ❌ No way to match users without email addresses

### After Fix
- ✅ Employee files work with or without email column
- ✅ Name-based matching as intelligent fallback
- ✅ Devon McHugh and others correctly identified as "✅ Employee"
- ✅ All 58 departments from employee file in dropdown
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing data and workflows

## How It Works

```
User Upload Flow:
1. Upload employee file (with or without email)
2. System attempts email-based matching first
3. If no email match, tries name-based matching
4. Employee record found → User marked as Employee
5. Employee record not found → User marked as Unidentified

Matching Logic:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User from AI Tool Usage Data        │
│ email: devon.mchugh@company.com     │
│ name: "Devon McHugh"                │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Try: db.get_employee_by_email()     │
│ Result: None (no email in emp file) │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Try: db.get_employee_by_name()      │
│ Parse: "Devon" + "McHugh"           │
│ Result: ✅ Match found!             │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Employee Record Retrieved:          │
│ ✅ Employee                         │
│ 🔒 Compliance                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Deployment Notes

- No database migration required (schema change is additive)
- No impact to existing employee records
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Users can re-upload employee files without email column immediately
